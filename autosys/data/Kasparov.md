## Question:

**_Can we find a way to calculate the inflation of chess ratings in a fair and accurate way?_**

### Notes

-   He is arrogant ... but he has earned it
-   His assessments are careful and thoughtful
-   I believe he has a point about rating inflation
-   Today's players have the chance to learn from previous generations
-   Modern players can also play constantly against computers
-   Skills can be practiced
-   Different end games can be replayed 100 times in a day against a computer to see what happens
