The period of an expulsion may not exceed one year unless, after a review, the district determines that:</p><p style="text-indent:13ex;" class="left">(1)  the student is a threat to the safety of other students or to district employees;  or</p><p style="text-indent:13ex;" class="left">(2)  extended placement is in the best interest of the student.  After a school district notifies the parents or guardians of a student that the student has been expelled, the parent or guardian shall provide adequate supervision of the student during the period of expulsion.</p><p style="text-indent:7ex;" class="left">(i)  If a student withdraws from the district before an order for placement in a disciplinary alternative education program or expulsion is entered under this section, the principal or board, as appropriate, may complete the proceedings and enter an order.
